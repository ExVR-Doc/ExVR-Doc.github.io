# Best Practices for Issue Reporting {docsify-ignore}
When troubleshooting software/game issues, precise feedback helps developers resolve problems faster. Follow these guidelines:

## Feedback Guidelines {docsify-ignore}
1. Provide reproduction steps
2. Record clear, focused bug demonstration videos showing specific operations
3. Verify if it's a genuine bug rather than user error
4. Avoid submitting:
   - Short, meaningless videos
   - Vague text-only descriptions
   - Single photos without context (Videos better demonstrate operational issues)
5. Do NOT ask about issues already resolved in group announcements/docs
